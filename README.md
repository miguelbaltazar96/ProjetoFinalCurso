# Panoramix
Panoramix is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension that enhances the functionality of the Why3 verification platform. With Panoramix, you can seamlessly integrate Why3 into your development workflow, allowing for efficient and reliable formal verification of your code.

## Features
->File type detection: Panoramix accurately detects files with the ".mlw" or ".why" extensions, ensuring that the extension correctly identifies them as valid files for processing.
->Connecting to the Why3 server: The extension establishes a connection with the Why3 server, enabling seamless communication and interaction with the verification platform.
->Handling notifications: Panoramix can receive and handle notifications sent by the Why3 server, ensuring that you are promptly informed about the status and progress of your verification tasks.
->Proof tree visualization: The extension provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing the proof tree generated by Why3. It accurately displays the tree structure, including parent-child relationships and node types, allowing you to navigate and explore the proof in a convenient manner.
->Task implementation and icons: Panoramix supports the implementation of tasks for specific nodes in the proof tree. It associates appropriate icons to nodes based on their type and status (proved or unproved), enhancing the visual representation and understanding of the proof.
->Command integration: The extension offers various commands for interacting with the Why3 verification platform. You can start a proofing session, stop a session, save a session, and perform other actions seamlessly within Visual Studio Code.
